    <p>参考<a href="../c16/c16-4.html#multicolumn">这里</a>。</p>
    <p>column-count属性值是一个自然数(0，小数，负数语法可能没错，但不会生效)，表示将元素内容显示为多少列。</p>
    <p>column-rule设置列之间的样式、颜色、宽度，类似于border属性。</p>
    <p>column-fill指定内容在列与列之间的分布方式，值有balance和auto。w3c:主流浏览器都不支持 column-fill 属性。</p>
    <p>本小节不深入研究了。</p>

            Speaking to reporters, the president defended his July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine as entirely appropriate,
            and stopped short of directly confirming news reports about what was discussed. But he acknowledged that he had discussed
            Mr. Biden during the call and accused the former vice president of corruption tied to his son Hunter’s business activities in the former Soviet republic.

            “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and
            largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,
            ” Mr. Trump told reporters before leaving for a trip to Texas and Ohio.

            It is still far from clear that the latest scandal surrounding Mr. Trump’s conduct will lead Ms. Pelosi or other top
            Democrats to bless following through with full impeachment proceedings and a vote. The House Judiciary Committee is already investigating whether to recommend articles of
            impeachment against Mr. Trump over other matters, but Ms. Pelosi has consistently questioned the strength of the case.

            Proponents of impeachment have repeatedly pointed to damaging revelations — including several instances of possible obstruction of justice by
            Mr. Trump detailed by the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference with the 2016 election — that they believe warrant seeking
            Mr. Trump’s removal. But they have run into resistance or indifference from their colleagues and the general public. And given near-unanimous Republican opposition,
            any impeachment proceeding would likely be a wholly partisan exercise that would all but certainly result in an acquittal by the Senate.
